Hi!😄 I am Boyu Xiao, an incoming Master's student at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn) advised by Prof. [Bin Cui](https://cuibinpku.github.io/), and currently a fourth-year undergraduate student at [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn/). I was also a research intern at [MDC](https://db.hit.edu.cn/main.htm), where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Hongzhi Wang](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/wang) and Prof. [Zemin Chao](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/chaozemin).

I have previously worked on time series data query and mining, and I am now eager to pursue meaningful research in AI systems.
